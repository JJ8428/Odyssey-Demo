Odyssey Demo Website

* Incomplete Project*

This is a project I created that serves as a website to help users create and plan itineraries using numerous API's. It is incomplete as of now, but it stil has decent fucntionality:
The main features being:
1. Account creation/deletion
2. User Login and Logout using JWT tokens with verification (hard-coded without using Passport.js)
3. Numerous connections to numerous APIs such as Google, Ticketmaster, etc. 
  - Allows users to browse for events, locations, places, etc in a neat screen. 
4. Displays understanding on how to use NoSQL databases
5. Partial Implementation of algorithm that generates best possible schedule using numerous factors, such as KMC algorithms based on Lat/Lng and (where applicable)

Overall the project just took too long for me to finish due to having a busy schedule and constant obstacles being thrown at me.
