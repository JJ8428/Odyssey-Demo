# 🗺️ Odyssey-Demo

**Odyssey Demo Website**

Odyssey is a website designed to help users create and plan itineraries using multiple APIs. Although the project is incomplete, it showcases key functionality that demonstrates web development skills, API integration, and database usage.

## ⚠️ Incomplete Project

This project is a work-in-progress. While it has not yet reached full functionality, it currently offers several key features:

### 🌟 Main Features:
- **Account Management**:
  - ✨ Account creation and deletion
  - 🔐 User login and logout using JWT tokens with verification (manually implemented without Passport.js)
  
- **API Integrations**:
  - 🔗 Numerous connections to various APIs like Google, Ticketmaster, etc.
  - 🔍 Users can browse events, locations, and places in a clean, organized interface

- **Database Management**:
  - Demonstrates the use of a **NoSQL database** for managing user and itinerary data

- **Schedule Optimization**:
  - Incomplete implementation of an algorithm that generates the best possible schedule for users
  - Includes **K-Means Clustering (KMC)** based on latitude and longitude to optimize event/stop choices (where applicable)

## 🚧 Why It's Incomplete

Despite the solid progress made, the project is currently on hold due to time constraints and other priorities. The core features are functional, but there are unfinished components that would bring more value to the project. Completing it would require more time, which I currently don't have due to a busy schedule and unexpected challenges along the way.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Finish implementing the scheduling algorithm
- Refine the user interface for a better experience
- Add more robust error handling and security layers (e.g., Passport.js for authentication)
- Complete API integrations to expand the variety of services users can access
